Space - Make cubes float forward, erasing all velocity on start.

A/D - Move horizontally.

W/S - Move vertically.


Hold R to restart.


### Cheat

Press ; to add 80 cubes to your side.

Press ' to reset #cube to 200 (in case there are too many).

(Ironically, this might be buggy. Use at your own risk.)
